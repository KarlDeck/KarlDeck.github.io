    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <h2>This is the naiive variant, with no finetuning and just a quick pyramid search:</h2>
    You can see that the photos are not cropped and also the color is not adjusted

    <img src="Photo2.jpg" alt="Zoom in">

    When you take a selfie up close, the camera exaggerates features like the nose and forehead because they’re much closer to the lens than the rest of the face, causing distortion. By stepping back and zooming in, the relative distances even out, reducing distortion and creating a more natural, flattering portrait.

    <h2>Task 2:</h2>

    When you zoom in from far away, distances along the street look compressed—the buildings and objects seem stacked closer together—because the narrow field of view reduces perspective cues. When you move closer and use no zoom, the wide-angle view exaggerates depth, making the same objects appear farther apart.
